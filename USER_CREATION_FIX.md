# User Creation Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were not being inserted into the database after email verification.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely one of these:

1. **Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)** blocking insertions
2. **Missing service role key** in environment variables
3. **Silent errors** not being logged properly
4. **Database connection issues**

## What Was Fixed

### Enhanced Error Logging

Added comprehensive logging to `src/services/auth.service.ts` → `verifyRegistration()`:

**Before:**
- Minimal logging
- Errors caught but not detailed
- Hard to debug where it failed

**After:**
- ✅ 8 detailed log points throughout the flow
- ✅ Full error stack traces
- ✅ JSON error details
- ✅ Success/failure at each step

### Log Points Added:

1. Password generation
2. Password hashing  
3. User creation attempt
4. User creation success
5. Status update
6. Profile creation
7. Email sending
8. Session cleanup

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Run the server and test

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then complete a registration and watch the console logs.

### Step 2: Look for these messages

```
✅ Generated password for user@example.com
✅ Password hashed successfully
✅ Attempting to create user
✅ User created successfully with ID: uuid
✅ Creating garage profile
✅ Garage profile created successfully
```

### Step 3: Identify where it stops

If logs stop at a certain point, that's where the error is.

## Most Likely Solutions

### Solution 1: Disable RLS (Recommended for Development)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE garage_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE verification_codes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE registration_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Solution 2: Verify Environment Variables

Check `.env` file:

```bash
# Must use SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, not anon key!
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Get the service role key from:
**Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API → service_role (secret)**

### Solution 3: Check Database Tables

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('users', 'garage_profiles', 'verification_codes');

-- If missing, run database/schema.sql
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Registration Flow:

```bash
# 1. Register (Step 1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register/step1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "phoneNumber": "+971501234567"
  }'

# Save the sessionId from response

# 2. Add Location (Step 2)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register/step2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "address": "Test Address",
    "street": "Main St",
    "state": "Dubai",
    "location": "Dubai Marina"
  }'

# 3. Add Business (Step 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register/step3 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "companyLegalName": "Test LLC",
    "tradeLicenseNumber": "123456"
  }'

# 4. Verify (this should create the user)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sessionId": "YOUR_SESSION_ID",
    "code": "123456"
  }'
```

### Expected Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration successful! Your password has been sent to your email.",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "email": "test@test.com",
      "role": "garage_owner",
      "status": "active"
    },
    "profile": {
      "fullName": "Test User",
      "email": "test@test.com",
      "phoneNumber": "+971501234567"
    },
    "accessToken": "...",
    "refreshToken": "...",
    "generatedPassword": "RandomPass123!" // Development only
  }
}
```

### Check Database:

```sql
-- Should return 1 row
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@test.com';

-- Should return 1 row  
SELECT * FROM garage_profiles WHERE email = 'test@test.com';
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/auth.service.ts`
   - Added 8+ logger.info() statements
   - Enhanced error logging with stack traces
   - Added JSON error serialization

## New Files Created

1. `VERIFICATION_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`
   - Complete debugging checklist
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Testing procedures

2. `USER_CREATION_FIX.md` (this file)
   - Quick fix summary
   - Most common solutions

## Next Steps

1. **Disable RLS** (most likely fix)
2. **Run test** registration flow
3. **Check logs** to see progress
4. **Verify database** has user record

If still not working after disabling RLS, check the detailed logs and share them for further debugging.
